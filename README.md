## Question 1 
  
in this we had  to make a guessing game in which we have to set the limit of the upper and lower bound of random number and the player have 6 tries to guess the number 

The logic the i used in this code  is 

 A while loop to cause while loop good in using in conditions   i gave to argument (1)->the total guess allowed and (2)->and a counter to count how much guesses the player has left 

 the i use if statemnt to check if the guess is matching the answer it it is then i print a message that the user had won  if he guess lower that the answer i print that the answer is greater that the guess and same for lower guess logic
